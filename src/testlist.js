// testlist.js — THE TEST QUEUE (requirement: can we have a to test feature list somewhere in the
// pause menu while we are testing it should be updated when we add new features and remove approved
// features). Shown in the PAUSE menu, TEST MODE only (menu.js pause -> TESTING).
// THE RULE (CLAUDE.md §1): every feature handed over for a phone test gets an entry here IN THE
// SAME TASK; when the user approves it, DELETE the entry (and note the verdict in TODO.md). Keep
// each line short: it is read on a phone, mid-session.
//   id     stable key            added   date it went in (yyyy-mm-dd)
//   where  how to get to it      try     what to do      wrong   what would count as a bug
